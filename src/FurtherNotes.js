                        Faith in faith itself means exactly what it says. It is a belief in the power of the belief itself.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With children with bone cancer, with unexpected death and tragedy in the world it is through our faith in a heavenly future that we can find even more spirit to act to vanquish this. We need to recognize sin as everything that is not complete devotion to our highest paths.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It is to believe in the perfection and beauty of the world in its current state, to believe in the future beauty, and to understand the necessity of this ream for the fulfillment of the self.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Why does religion and belief in a higher decision maker, make people better?
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        ALL OF THE THINGS YOU DO TO PUSH YOURSELF AND OTHERS TO BE BETTER WILL COME WITH MORE REWARDS THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Faith is a tool, and like any tool it can be used positively or negatively.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You cannot connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking back.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You cannot decipher the reasons, and if you get caught up looking for the signs you’re going to steer off the road.

                        The one step path was something I realized I actually was just being grateful for having in my toolkit. I was grateful I could feel good at any time. I was essentially being grateful that I could feel gratitude.

                        <br />
                        Gratitude can be a necessary component of this, when an individual may feel

                        <br />
                        I am grateful for the fact that I can feel grateful.

                        <br />
                        Ask yourself, what does God need from the world? What is God’s hardest battle with us. Acceptance of his divinity and devotion of ourselves to a higher calling. God is a representation the world needs.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When everyone else is running away from difficult problems, it is our job to run towards them. When everyone has their eyes on the next day, we have our eyes on eternity.

                        The Vible is not a religion, it’s a top tier vibe.

                        <br />
                        The Vible states no things that are in conflict with any major religions.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The point of the Vible is to provide a rational, universal, and simple framework to kill doubt, and find faith.

                        <br />

                        Irrational faith is someone who has faith that everything will be done for them. These people may not take their child to the doctor when sick because their child is in god’s hands. These people may tell you its good that your brother committed suicide because God has a plan.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Imagine a parent who does not let their child use an epipen, as they suffocate to death, because they trust God/Some Higher Being’s plan. This is irrational faith.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Faith also has an intoxicating effect. Part of this idea is called the “God Shaped Hole” which is a reason why the inevitability of a higher power will return. One based on truth and natural law will stick into eternity.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Also, one that is open minded to having its “holy texts” rewritten can change with the times rather than this current lock-in mechanism of current religions causing them to fail.

                        Holy text prophecies will become understood in their modern sense.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For example, the day the Singularity comes and judgement day being synonymous.

                        <br />
                        When we keep up the good vibes up it gives us a much better pulse at what actually is bad vibes. The way we sustain our good vibes is working to eliminate those bad vibes from manifesting. The prophets of our generation are simply the ones who understand the future and act accordingly. <b>We will allow god (this higher understanding of the way the universe works) to work through us to save this world from its suffering.</b> It will be us, helping us, and it will be an age of love.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Work is an act of returning to faith. Faith you’re doing the right thing for the right story to be told. Mindfulness in a non-sloth state is fine. Wait till you have the motivations to continue.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As long as you are motivated enough to sit up, you can practice being in the present moment, and the motivation to do greater things will flow.

To give individuals hope and faith that had been lost. To give the idea of love and support that too many lack. Who lack it simply because they lack the faith in finding and feeling it. And so by bringing their faith forward, bringing their hope forward, we allow them to love themselves. We allow one to see only the positive in their past. To accept their past, to love their past for it has happened for a reason. To find that reason in the present, to love the present and to have hope for the future, and love for their part of it.
